<div class="thinkTag">

Alright, the user greeted me with "你好," which means "hello" in Chinese. I should respond politely in the same language to keep the conversation flowing smoothly. Let me make sure my response is friendly and welcoming. Maybe I can ask how I can assist them today. Keeping it simple and open-ended should work best.

你好！很高兴见到你。有什么我可以帮助你的吗？
