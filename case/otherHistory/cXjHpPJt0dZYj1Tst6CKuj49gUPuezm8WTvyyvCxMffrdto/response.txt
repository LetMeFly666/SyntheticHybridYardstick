<div class="thinkTag">

Alright, the user greeted me with "你好", which means "hello" in Chinese. I should respond politely in the same language to keep the conversation flowing smoothly. Let me make sure my response is friendly and welcoming. Maybe add a smiley to keep it warm. Also, check for any typos. Okay, that should do it.
